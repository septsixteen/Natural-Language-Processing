# Natural-Language-Processing
Projects on NPL using Python and mySQL

- Mine and process text data in the web
- Analyze our data sets, perform sentiment analysis using various NLP techniques in Python libraries scikit-learn, Spacy, pattern, nltk: 
   + Machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naiyes Bayes, Clustering, Classification, and deep learning methods in scikit-learn Neural Net in Keras API, 
   + Lexicon based techniques: VADER, SentiWordNet, Spacy, pattern, etc. 
- Use various cross-validation methods to create multiple train/test data sets for training and testing the models.
Perform variable Selections such as PCA, LDA, weights.
- Train, fit, and validate the models. 
- Explore different parameters to find the combination that performs best. 
The effectiveness of the algorithms of the prediction are measured using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), recall, precision, and f-measure tests as below. The models are compared using ROC for overall performance
- Perform Topic Modelling, Text Similarity
- Words of Bags, TF-IDF Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency, etc. 
- Visualize the findings with interactive and statics vizual effects  such as pyLDAvis and matplotlib.
